# Arrowhead X.509 Certificate Profiles

This repository organizes the work being done to produce X.509 Profiles for Eclipse Arrowhead.

The purpose of the profiles are to facilitate both _security_ and _access control_ within Arrowhead local clouds, primarily by identifying the kind and identity of each entity attempting to establish a secure connection via TLS or DTLS, and of those issuing such identities.

The work currently being done on the profile are to be found in the following documents:

| Document                             | Description |
|:-------------------------------------|:------------|
| [`proposal.md`](proposal.md)         | The concrete document proposal, in Markdown.
| [`requirements.md`](requirements.md) | Various technical requirements that must be satisfied by the proposal.

When the [proposal](proposal.md) is finished, it will be turned into a formatted documented and moved to a more permanent location.
At that point, this repository is likely to be archived or removed.
